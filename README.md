# IHX Coding Challenge

## Description
This project is the solution to the IHX coding challenge provided. This repo consists of 5 different problems.

## Usage
```
go run cmd/${PROBLEM_FOLDER}/main.go
```

## Problem and Solution

### 1. Swap

#### Brief Description
Swap two variables without an extra variable

#### Algorithm
1. Given the variables are named a and b
2. Get the sum of the variables by adding both of variables to `a` (`a = a+b`)
3. Assign the original value `a`, by subtracting the sum with variable b, assign to variable b (`b = a-b`)
4. Since `b` is now the original value of `a`, the original value of `b` can be derived by subtracting the sum with original value of `a` in `b` (`a = a-b`)
